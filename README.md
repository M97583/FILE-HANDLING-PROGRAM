*The CODTECH internship program provides an excellent opportunity for budding programmers to gain hands-on experience in core areas of computer science, including file handling, data structures, compiler design, and data compression techniques. During this internship, participants are required to complete four essential tasks. Successful completion of these tasks before the deadline will earn the intern a completion certificate, marking their achievement and skill development.

Task 1: WRITE A PROGRAM TO CREATE, READ, WRITE, AND APPEND DATA TO A FILE.
Task 2:SINGLY LINKED LIST WITH OPERATIONSLIKE INSERTION, DELETION, AND TRAVERSAL.
Task 3:BUILD A SIMPLE LEXICAL ANALYZER THAT IDENTIFIES KEYWORDS,OPERATORS, AND IDENTIFIERS FROM AN INPUT FILE.
Task 4: BASIC DATA COMPRESSION ALGORITHM LIKE RUN-LENGTH ENCODING (RLE).

Task 1: File Handling in C
The first task focuses on file operations using the C programming language. Interns must write a program that can create, read, write, and append data to a file. This task will help interns understand how data is stored persistently in files rather than just in memory. They will practice opening and closing files using different modes (w, r, a, etc.), handling errors during file operations, and performing I/O operations efficiently. Mastering file handling is crucial because it forms the basis for many real-world applications, such as logging systems, data storage, and configuration management.

Task 2: Singly Linked List Implementation
The second task challenges interns to build a singly linked list from scratch. The program must support basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. Through this task, interns will gain insight into dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and the importance of modular coding practices. Singly linked lists are fundamental data structures that are used in various systems, from operating system kernels to complex applications like text editors. This task also emphasizes writing clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

Task 3: Lexical Analyzer
The third task introduces interns to basic compiler design concepts by creating a simple lexical analyzer. The goal is to write a C program that reads from an input file and identifies keywords, operators, and identifiers. This task provides an initial understanding of how compilers break down code into tokens, which is the first step in translating human-readable code into machine instructions. Interns will learn about string manipulation, pattern matching, and how programming languages are interpreted by machines. The deliverable is a working lexical analyzer that outputs tokens found in a sample source file.

Task 4: Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
The final task involves implementing a basic data compression algorithm, specifically Run-Length Encoding (RLE). The program must be capable of both compressing and decompressing text files. RLE is a simple yet effective technique that reduces file size by replacing sequences of repeated characters with a single character and its count. Through this task, interns will understand the importance of data compression in reducing storage requirements and transmission time. It introduces them to algorithmic thinking and how data representation affects performance.

The CODTECH internship tasks are designed to build strong programming fundamentals while exposing interns to key areas of computer science. Each task promotes problem-solving, logical thinking, and practical application of concepts learned in theory. Interns are encouraged to use internet resources responsibly, follow group updates, and submit their solutions before the deadline to secure their completion certificate. By the end of the internship, participants will have a solid portfolio of C programs showcasing their ability to handle file systems, data structures, compiler basics, and data compression.*
